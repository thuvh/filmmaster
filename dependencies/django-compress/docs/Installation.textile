h1. Installation

Installation is pretty straight-forward and follows the same installation procedure as many other Django applications. django-compress does not create any models, so you do not need to configure a database.

h3. Recommendations

By default django-compress uses CSSTidy to compress CSS. CSSTidy is an excellent stand-alone application for dealing with CSS-files. CSSTidy can be downloaded from: http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/. If you do not install CSSTidy, make sure to disable the filter in your settings (by setting COMPRESS_CSS_FILTERS = None).

h3. Install instructions

# Get the code from svn: svn co http://django-compress.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ django-compress
** Use the setup.py script to install: python setup.py install
** OR manually put the compress-directory somewhere on your PYTHONPATH 
# Add 'compress' to your INSTALLED_APPS 

h3. Using git?

The main source repository is now available at github: http://github.com/pelme/django-compress/tree/master

The Subversion repository at Google Code will still be updated, though.

If you want to grab django-compress via git, use: git clone git://github.com/pelme/django-compress.git
